Polymorphism:

It is an OOP concept which means that a child class can overload and/or override
the methods created in the SuperClass through inheritance.

Polymorphism is useful when child classes can use the same methods implemented in the superclass

Inheritance is done by using the keyword "extends nameOfSuperClass" in all child classes.

Keywords:

*"extends" - used to inherit properties of the superclass

*"super.methodOfSuperClass" - refers to the parent class
